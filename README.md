# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

As baby boomers are retiring, Pewlett-Hackard is looking forward to prepare for all the vacancies that will be available in the near future.

As part of HR analyst team,  we need to answer who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions we'll need to fill.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* As per deliverable 1 we can notice that the two main positions that will be retiring are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. We might be a little bit more concerned about the engineering people, since this kind of positions take more time to prepare to specific functions and tasks, if we don't have a correct succession plan all the knowledge from senior positions will be lost.
* In order to make future decisions on this, we suggest to dig a little bit more on which deparments will be affected the most by this wave.
* The mentorshop-elegibility program is perfect to face this challenge, as a suggestion we can amplify the range of ages that are being considered within the program as well as specify that the people who are elegible belongs to the kind of positions that will be leaving shortly.
* While running this kind of analysis, it is very important to pay attention to duplicate information, we need to understand very well the situation so that we don't run analysis without context. For example, people who changed position over the course of their carreers could have been taken as more people instead of just one person. This is just a reminder of how important it is to understand the problem and the data before moving forward as well as organizing data to understand relationships.

  ### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  We don't have enough qualified people to participate, facing this situation HR needs to prepare to coordinate an additional program to attract people with the expertise and knowledge we are looking for, cause mentoring program will not cover the gap.
